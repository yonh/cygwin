.SS "Description"
\fCsource\fP evaluates the commands of the specified file in the current shell\&. This is different from starting a new process to perform the commands (i\&.e\&. \fCfish < FILENAME\fP) since the commands will be evaluated by the current shell, which means that changes in shell variables will affect the current shell\&. If additional arguments are specified after the file name, they will be inserted into the $argv variable\&.
.PP
If no file is specified, or if the file name '\fC-\fP' is used, stdin will be read\&.
.PP
The return status of \fCsource\fP is the return status of the last job to execute\&. If something goes wrong while opening or reading the file, \fCsource\fP exits with a non-zero status\&.
.PP
\fC\&.\fP (a single period) is an alias for the \fCsource\fP command\&. The use of \fC\&.\fP is deprecated in favour of \fCsource\fP, and \fC\&.\fP will be removed in a future version of fish\&.
